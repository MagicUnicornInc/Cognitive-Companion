For the README of your forked project, you‚Äôll want to clearly outline the purpose of your fork, how it differs from the original AnythingLLM, and what unique value your modifications bring. Here‚Äôs a structured and tailored example based on your goals with Cognitive Companion:

Cognitive Companion

Cognitive Companion is a fork of AnythingLLM reimagined as an advanced interface for modular AI systems. This project integrates Open Interpreter, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and Magic Control Protocol (MCP) for seamless and extensible AI-driven workflows.

üöÄ Features
	1.	Open Interpreter Integration
Effortlessly run code snippets, process commands, and interact with various APIs, all through a natural language interface.
	2.	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	‚Ä¢	Modular RAG pipeline using tools like txtai for contextual information retrieval.
	‚Ä¢	Supports local LLaMA models (7B and 13B quantized) for fast, efficient query responses.
	3.	Magic Control Protocol (MCP)
	‚Ä¢	Centralized orchestration of connected AI modules, making complex task automation easier and more efficient.
	‚Ä¢	Real-time AI-to-AI communication and modular task management.
	4.	Enhanced User Interface
	‚Ä¢	Intuitive UI built on the robust foundations of AnythingLLM.
	‚Ä¢	Customizable dashboards for tracking workflows and AI interactions.
	5.	Open Source Philosophy
Fully open-source with modularity at its core, allowing users to adapt, extend, and innovate.

üõ† How to Install

Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.10+
	‚Ä¢	Node.js 18+
	‚Ä¢	Tesla P40 GPU (Optional): Recommended for GPU-accelerated model inference.

Setup
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/cognitive-companion.git
cd cognitive-companion


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install


	3.	Configure the environment:
	‚Ä¢	Add your RAG data source (e.g., txtai or custom embeddings).
	‚Ä¢	Connect Open Interpreter via interpreter.config.json.
	‚Ä¢	Set up MCP modules in mcp.config.json.
	4.	Run the application:

npm run dev

üéØ Use Cases
	‚Ä¢	AI Research Companion: Summarize papers, generate code, or analyze data with Open Interpreter.
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise AI: Build intelligent document workflows with RAG and scalable AI.
	‚Ä¢	Creative Automation: Use MCP to orchestrate complex AI pipelines for content generation, task management, and more.
